🚀 Machine Learning Projects - 5
📌 Overview

This repository contains three different machine learning projects. Various models have been trained and compared. The models were developed using classical machine learning methods and evaluated using different metrics.

📊 Datasets 

     1️⃣ Physical Fitness Classification
📂 Dataset:

Includes information on individuals' age, gender, height, weight, body fat percentage, blood pressure, grip strength, flexibility, sit-up count, and broad jump distance. 🏃‍♂️💪 The goal is to classify individuals into different fitness levels.

    2️⃣ Titanic Survival Prediction
📂 Dataset:

🚢 Contains passenger information from the Titanic disaster, including survival status, class, age, gender, ticket fare, and embarkation point. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived.



    3️⃣ Weather Prediction

📂 Dataset:

🌡️ Includes features such as temperature, 🌧️ humidity, 💨 wind speed, ☔ precipitation percentage, ☁️ cloud cover, 🌍 atmospheric pressure, 🌞 UV index, 🏔️ season, 👀 visibility, and 📍 location type. The goal is to classify different weather conditions.
